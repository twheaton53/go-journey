# go-journey
A collaborative travel app where friends and family can build an itinerary together.

# To install
Clone the repository to a folder and open with your editor of choice, navigate to the main directory and run "npm install" to install the dependencies. Server port is listed in server/index.js, you can change to whatever port you wish to use. Run "npm start" to fire up the express server and have it begin listening to the port you selected (default is 3000).

# To use
The user will be prompted to select a destination location, the location will go into the title of the trip. The user can then select how many days the trip will be (arrival and departure) and the overview boxes will adjust to how many days of the trip. The user can change the title of the days i.e. "Arrival Day" or "Museum Day".

The user will have the option to select an arrow on the side of the trip overview that will open up that specific day and allow the user to input itinerary plans throughout the day. This allows you to see what you have planned each day, where at, relevant links and information, and who has decided to attend that specific event or not.
